Tigers are on the verge of extinction and are globally listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN. Donating to any of the following charities will help raise wild tiger populations, and help to protect them from a variety of threats:

* [Panthera](https://www.panthera.org/initiative/save-tiger-fund)
* [Worldwildlife](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/tiger)
* [SaveTigersNow](https://www.savetigersnow.org/)


P.S. Not affiliated with any of these organizations. I've just heard great things about them.

Thanks for reading!
