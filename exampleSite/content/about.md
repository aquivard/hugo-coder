Unfortunately, there are only a few tiger live cams, and most of them have stopped working and such. The only ones that are in working condition right now are the ones on explore.org, and are by Big Cat Rescue. I will list the tiger live cams in order from best to worst. 

1) [Big Cat Rescue Tiger Lake](https://explore.org/livecams/big-cat-rescue/big-cat-rescue-tiger-lake)

The best one by a fair extent. Video is nice and crisp, and the tigers look like they're having a fun time - they aren't enclosed in any small cages, and are allowed to roam free within the huge enclosure.

2) [Big Cat Rescue Vacation Rotation](https://explore.org/livecams/big-cat-rescue/big-cat-rescue-vacation-rotation)

Mediorce. Most of the time there aren't any tigers visible. Fixed view. Also, it doesn't only feature tigers but tigers and lions, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

3) [Big Cat Rescue Feeding Station](https://explore.org/livecams/big-cat-rescue/big-cat-rescue-feeding-station)

Another mediocre one. Live cam has fixed view, and most of the time the tigers are not visible. Again, it doesn't only feature tigers but tigers and lions, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
